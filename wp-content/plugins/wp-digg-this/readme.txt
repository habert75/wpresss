== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? =

WP Digg This uses Digg API to show the Digg button with the number of Diggs. It shows the button only on selected posts and this is what differs it from other similar plugins.

= How do I show the button on the right side instead? =

You can edit the plugin replace "float: left; margin-right: 10px;" with "float: right; margin-left: 10px;"
